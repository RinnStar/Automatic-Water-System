## General Information
- How is this project related to embedded/firmware engineering?
    - For embedded engineering: The design of this project deals with hardware integration. Configuring components such as the Arduino UNO, water pump and tube, Soil Moisture Sensor, 5 Volt Relay Module, and the jumper wires. Another embedded engineering topic that this project deals with is Sensor Interface. Fo this
